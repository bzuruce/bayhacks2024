### Tips
- focusing on prototype ideas in a fast and hacky way, no need to be perfect
- leverage ChatGPT to get example codes whenever possible

### Process
1. Decide what to build (15m)
- pick up a track
- brainstrom an app for a scenario

2. plan how to build - mini design phase (20m)
- break down the app into small task items, each takes more than 15 minutes, e.g.:
- data layer: store things in memory and use streamlit st_session
- determine UI layout at the high level
- decide the first one or two important features

3. build, test and debug
- build things in parallel, each member works on different tasks
- once a task is fully tested locally, merge it to GitHub for the other member to pick it up
- do final integrated test on one laptop
